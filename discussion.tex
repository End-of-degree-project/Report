Gadgets by nature are just embedded interactuable applications, decoupled from the context they are in. With increasing computing power, even in mobile devices, the difference in power needed to complete a task between JavaScript and other native languages [link] starts getting neglegible. GWT achieves high compatibility with all different browsers [link], and with the help of different APIs can be a very good tool for creating gadgets in situations where the concept of the gadget can be extracted as a separate part from the context. The only limitation is it is not possible to get outside of the gadget apart from what the API provides.\\\\
Gadgets are a relatively easy way to extend Wave, as no actual knowled of Wave's codebase is needed to do so. But still the Gadgets API is far from perfect, and requires the developer to repeat tasks for every gadget made. Also, version mismatches will throw out cryptic messages that are useless to fix the actual problem. Many steps need to be followed to get things working.\\\\
Also, even though the Gadgets API is a Java API, the fact that it generates JavaScript code means troubleshooting is sometimes needed in the JavaScript layer, so JavaScript knowledge is also needed, and generated code is not usually easy to follow and understand [link].
