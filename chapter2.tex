\begin{itemize}
\anotacion{``Materials'' doesn't make sense, ``Methods'' does. This includes a (technical) explanation/description of the technologies used. You can mention the challenges implied by the lack of documentation, as Google didn't release all the software/docs/APIs/etc. The specific problems go in Results/Discussion, not here, as here the approach is ``before'' implementation.}
  \item Wanted to explore both ways to extend wave
  \item Talk about specific software I used?
  \item How to create a gadget, alternatives, GWT (How is GWT used in wave, what does GWT do)
  \item How to create a robot, alternatives, how much detail?
  \item Servers for gadgets and robots, how to communicate them with wave
  \item Should I talk about the problems I had?
  \item Talk about the lack of documentation?
\end{itemize}
