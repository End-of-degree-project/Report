\subsection{Colorizer Robot}

In Wave it is possible to see who has participated somewhere, but it is not possible to see exactly what that participant has modified. This extension, in the shape of a robot, goes around that problem by assigning a color to each participant, and painting the background of the text that participant edits. That way, everyone can know who is the author of everything.
