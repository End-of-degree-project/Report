\section{Extensions}

Both possible ways for extending Wave have been explored in this work. Gadgets have been implemented with the Wave Gadgets API, and robots with the Java version of the robots API.

To understand where these extensions live, it is necessary to understand how wave is structured. In Figure \ref{fig:wave_structure}
\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{Wave Structure}
  \label{fig:wave_structure}
\end{figure}
you can see how Wave documents are structured. The outermost layer is the wave, a thread or conversation, the whole picture of a conversation. Users are invited to the wave, letting them participate in any of the inner wavelets, when they then become participants. As of today, in current versions of Wave In A Box and Kune, only one wavelet lives inside a wave, but the Wave Protocol allow for multiple wavelets. Blips are individual messages created by a participant, and edited by participants later. Blips have hierarchical structure and can be nested inside other blips.

Wave gadgets live inside a wave, and therefore are able to interact with it. Among other things, they can access the current state of the wave. There is two different kinds of state:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Private State\\
        Stores information that can only be accessed from the participant that modified it.
  \item Shared State\\
        Stores the global state of every gadget in this wave.
\end{itemize}

The state is actually an entity containing key-value pairs of strings. The state can be modified at any time, and the changes made to it will be communicated to the rest of the participants, so they can react accordingly to this change. This is represented in the next figure:

The Gadgets API requires you to create a class hierarchy to be able to succesfully compile. In a hypothetical gadget named ``Gadget'' it would be as follows:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio, scale=0.5]{Media/Diagrams/Gadget/Gadget.png}
\end{center}

For every gadget project it has also been implemented a tester and a deployer.

The intention of the tester is to take advantage of the ``Development Mode'' in GWT that allows you to run the code locally without deploying it to a web server. The class diagram for every tester project has followed the same pattern:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio, scale=0.6]{Media/Diagrams/Gadget/Tester.png}
\end{center}

The project is then run as a Web Application with Google's App Engine.

The deployer also follows a similar pattern:

\begin{center}

\end{center}

The difference between this two structures are the following: First, a Wave Mock is no longer needed, as our gadget will be in an environment with a real Wave behaviour, so the Wave class is bound from the GinModule. Also, the entry point now also extends the Gadget class, a class given by the Gadgets API which some behaviour needed for the Gadget to work in an actual environment.
