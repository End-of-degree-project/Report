\section*{Abstract}
This work explores the scene of Wave, and specifically attemps to set the base for developers to code concurrent applications under the Wave infrastructure.\\[.2cm]
Also various open source and documented extensions have been created that solve some of the existing and unsolved needs in the current incarnations on Wave.\\[.2cm]
It has also been in collaboration with other teams developing for Wave and has served the purpose of finishing and understanding incomplete documentation, which is a big impediment when trying to face development in Wave.
