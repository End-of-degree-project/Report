Apache Wave has been slowly developing since it was dropped by Google. Multiple aspects went away when that happened such as support, community and developers because some aspects remained undocumented, links were erased, and features truncated.\\[.2cm]
This work explores the scene of Wave, and specifically attemps to set the base for developers to code concurrent applications under the Wave infrastructure. Also, with the Robots API and Gadgets API, various open source and documented extensions have been created that solve some of the existing and unsolved needs in the current incarnations on Wave. It has also been in collaboration with other teams developing for Wave and has served the purpose of finishing and understanding incomplete documentation, which is a big impediment when trying to face development in Wave.\\[.2cm]
This can be the starting point for any developer interested in learning how to extend Apache Wave.
